- The pig dice game is played with 2 or more players. To keep the action going, we recommend 2-4 players.

# HOW TO PLAY PIG DICE
- 1: Grab a single die and 2 or more players
All you need to play a game of pig dice is a single die and a friend (or more)!

- 2: Determine who goes first
We suggest doing a roll-off to determine who goes first. Each player rolls the die once and the highest roll goes first, with play continuing clockwise. If players tie on the highest roll, the tying players roll again until a winner of the roll-off is determined.

- 3: Play the first turn
Roll the die to start the turn
The first player rolls a single die to begin the game. Their goal is to roll a number 2-6 to score points, and avoid rolling a one, which ends their turn. If the player has a scoring roll, they’re faced with a decision!

- Choose to reroll OR bank the score
Every turn ends in one of two ways. A player rolls a one during the turn and scores zero points for the turn, or the player banks their score after a point scoring roll (2-6).

- Reroll

Players may choose to improve their score during a turn by continuing to roll after any scoring roll and accumulating more points.

- For example:

1st roll: player rolls a 4 and has 4 (temporary) points. They choose to reroll
2nd roll: player rolls a 6 and now has 10 (temporary) points (4 + 6). They choose to reroll.
If, on their 3rd roll, they roll a 1, all the points for that turn are wiped out and they score a zero.
Bank the score

After any scoring roll, the player can choose to “bank” their score, which ends their turn, while also locking in all the cumulative points scored during the round. Points are not added to the score sheet until they are banked.

For example:

1st roll: player rolls a 4 and has 4 (temporary) points. They choose to reroll
2nd roll: player rolls a 6 and now has 10 (temporary) points (4 + 6). They choose to bank to points and add 10 points to their scoresheet. Their turn is over.
4: Alternate turns to complete the first round
Players alternate turns with two players, or rotate clockwise with three or more players. The rules for each turn are follow the same structure above.

5: Continue taking turns until one player earns 100 points and wins the game
During the second and subsequent rounds, the turns continue as outlined above. However, scoring is cumulative across all rounds and the first player to achieve 100 points wins the game. Rolling a 1 does not wipe out points banked in previous rounds.
